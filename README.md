## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a machine learning PhD student.
Here is my brief online profile.

Unfortunately, not all of my PhD research code is publically available. See the pinned repos for (earlier) part of it.

My coding experiences retrospectively:

- 2017-present: **Python** (computing libs, tensorflow, pytorch), **matlab**, **shell scripting** 
- 2016-2017: **SQL**, **HTML**, **PHP**, **shell scripting**
- undergraduate courses: **C**, **C++**, **matlab**, **shell scripting**
